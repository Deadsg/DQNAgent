# DQN Agent
A DQN Agent System that is in Development. Concept is to be implemented in self learing Q loop Algorithms for LLm learning.

# Description

This project aims to develop a deep Q-network (DQN) agent system that can learn from its own experiences and adapt to different environments. DQN is a reinforcement learning method that uses a neural network to approximate the optimal action-value function. The system will use a self-learning Q loop algorithm, which is a variant of Q-learning that updates the Q-values based on the agentâ€™s actions and rewards. The system will also use LLm learning, which is a technique that leverages the latent space of the neural network to improve the generalization and robustness of the agent.
 
# Install

## Windows

First you need to clone this repository. Using your preferred terminal console to navigate where you cloned this repository. Then run the following command in the terminal

```console
> .\bin\windows_start.bat
```

This will download and install a local miniconda python environment. It will then install the required dependendencies.

## Linux

 - TODO
 
## Mac

 - TODO
 
# Usuage
 
 - TODO This should include a brief overview of how to start and stop the agent.
